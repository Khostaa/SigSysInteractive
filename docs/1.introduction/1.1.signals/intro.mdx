# Signal

Let’s quickly dive into **signals**—starting from the absolute basics to build a solid understanding by the end.

## What is a Signal?

A **signal** is a function of one or more variables that represents some kind of physical phenomenon. In electrical circuits, signals are typically defined as changes in **voltage** or **current** over time.

Signals are the fundamental way data and information are transmitted through communication mediums like **optical fibers**, **coaxial cables**, or **electromagnetic waves**. Once transmitted, signals are processed by various electronic components like **ICs**, **transistors**, and **diodes** to perform desired tasks.

### Characteristics of a Signal

Before jumping into the types of signals, let’s first understand their key characteristics. Knowing how a signal behaves will help you get a much clearer picture of signal processing later on.

#### 1. **Amplitude**
The **amplitude** of a signal refers to its strength or magnitude. If we plot the signal on a graph with **time on the x-axis**, the amplitude is the maximum displacement along the **y-axis**. In simple terms, it shows how "strong" or "loud" the signal is.

#### 2. **Frequency**
The **frequency** of a signal is the number of oscillations it completes per second. It is defined as:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

Here, **T** is the **time period**, which is the duration of one complete cycle of the signal. Frequency tells us how fast a signal repeats itself, and a higher frequency means more cycles occur in a given time frame.

#### 3. **Time Period**
The **time period T** of a signal is the time it takes to complete one full cycle. It is inversely related to frequency: as frequency increases, the time period decreases, and vice versa.



### Types of Signals
- Continuous
- Discrete

## Some Popular Signals
Signals are widely used in every field in the world.
- Sigmoid
- tanhx
- sinx
- cosx
- sinc
- Unit Step Signal
- Ramp Signal
- Delta or Impulse

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
